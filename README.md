## Discussion topics from the issues

- How does the geometry of the area influence species accumulation?
- Does species group matter?
- What is the relationship between Brownian Motion models and Max Entropy?
- How about a dynamic ecosystem like the ocean?
- How well does it scale?
- What about species time?
- How do we deal with human bias?
- Can it really be this simple?
- What about process?
- What's a real world example of non-stationary?
- More about extinction?
- Other examples of how deviations are informative?
- When are there so many deviations we should move on?
- More on E0 and temperature?
